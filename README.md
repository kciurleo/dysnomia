# dysnomia

### Description
This is a homemade version of the classic card game Anomia, meant to be played online with friends over video chat or in person with multiple devices. Play [here] online and read the game instructions [here].

This app supports up to X players per room, as well as submissions of your own card packs [here].

This is still in the works and I'll edit this readme again later.

### Setup/Installation
Run ```npm install``` for setup and ```npm run serve``` to run the app locally.
